description: How agent tools work in ZeptoClaw
---

Tools are the actions your agent can take. Each tool implements the `Tool` trait with a name, description, parameter schema, and an async `execute` method.

## How tools work

When an LLM decides to use a tool, it returns a structured tool call with a name and JSON arguments. The agent loop:

1. Looks up the tool by name in the registry
2. Checks the approval gate (if configured)
3. Calls `execute()` with the arguments and a `ToolContext`
4. Sanitizes the result (strips large blobs, truncates)
5. Returns the result to the LLM

## Tool context

Every tool receives a `ToolContext` containing:

- **workspace** — Path to the agent's workspace directory
- **channel** — The originating channel name (e.g., "telegram")
- **chat_id** — The originating chat/conversation ID

## Built-in tools

ZeptoClaw ships with 17 built-in tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `shell` | Execute shell commands (with optional container isolation) |
| `read_file` | Read file contents from workspace |
| `write_file` | Write or create files in workspace |
| `list_files` | List directory contents |
| `edit_file` | Search-and-replace edits |
| `web_search` | Web search via Brave API |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch and parse web pages |
| `memory` | Search workspace memory (markdown files) |
| `longterm_memory` | Persistent key-value store with categories and tags |
| `message` | Send proactive messages to channels |
| `cron` | Schedule recurring tasks |
| `spawn` | Delegate background tasks |
| `delegate` | Create sub-agents (agent swarms) |
| `whatsapp` | Send WhatsApp messages via Cloud API |
| `gsheets` | Read and write Google Sheets |
| `r8r` | Content rating and analysis |

## Parallel execution

When the LLM returns multiple tool calls in one response, ZeptoClaw executes them concurrently using `futures::future::join_all`. This reduces latency when tools are independent.

## Result sanitization

Tool results are sanitized before being sent back to the LLM:

- Base64 data URIs are replaced with `[base64 data removed]`
- Hex blobs (>100 chars) are replaced with `[hex data removed]`
- Results exceeding 50KB are truncated

This prevents token waste from large binary outputs.

## Custom tools via plugins

You can add custom tools without modifying ZeptoClaw's source code using the [plugin system](/guides/plugins/). Plugins are JSON manifests that define tool name, parameters, and a command template.
